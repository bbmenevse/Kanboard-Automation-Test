# Kanboard Test Automation Project
## Summary
This project uses Kanboard as a base for learning test automation. You can check out the original application [here](https://kanboard.org/).

The project consists of two parts: browser automation tests and API tests. I’ve completed the browser-side tests using TestNG, but I’m still working on the API call tests.

### For browser-side tests, I’ve used the following frameworks/libraries:
- Selenium
- Selenide
- Testng

### For api call tests, I have used:
- Testng
- Cucumber
- Rest Assured
- Allure
