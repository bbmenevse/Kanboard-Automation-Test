# Kanboard Test Automation Project
## Summary
This project uses Kanboard as a base for learning test automation. You can check out the original application [here](https://kanboard.org/).

The project consists of two parts: browser automation tests and API tests. I’ve completed the browser-side tests using TestNG, but I’m still working on the API call tests.

### For browser-side tests, I’ve used the following frameworks/libraries:
- Selenium
- Selenide
- Testng

### For api call tests, I have used:
- Testng
- Cucumber
- Rest Assured
- Allure

## Kanboard

Kanboard is a simple, open-source project management tool based on Kanban boards. It helps track tasks, organize workflows, and manage projects visually. With features like swimlanes, subtasks, and automation, it’s great for keeping work organized and boosting productivity. Perfect for teams or solo users looking for a lightweight solution.
